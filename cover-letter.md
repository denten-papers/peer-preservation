To Whom It May Concern:

Attached, please find our manuscript, "Book Piracy as Peer Preservation." We hope it finds its way into the upcoming special issue on piracy and social change.

Little has been written about book piracy, and yet it is a topic that most directly influences our professional life. Our findings describe an international community which is likely to constitute one of the largest "shadow" libraries in the world, rivaling similar commercial efforts in reach and scope. Almost nothing is known about it from secondary sources. After much original research, we managed a thick description which will add important empirical evidence and some theoretical insight to the conversations on peer production, the future of the library, and STS.

We also affirm that this manuscript is not being considered, has not been submitted and is not being published in any other venue, either in part or whole.

Thank you for your time and consideration. With best wishes from New York,

Dennis Tenen and Maxwell Foxman
